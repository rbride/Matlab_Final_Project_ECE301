# Matlab_Final_Project_ECE301
The goal of this project was to use matlab to design and model a set of FIR and IIR filters 
in accordance with some supplied specifications. 

The first filter was a Linear Phase, minimum-length Band-pass FIR digital Filter. 
This filter was implemented in matlab using the following matlab methods: Rectagular and Hamming Windowing, Frequency Sampling,
Parks-McClellan Optimal Eqiripple, and finally least squared error Minimization

second Filter was a minimum-order band pass IIR filters. 
This was achieved in MATLAB using the following methods: 
A Butterworth Filter, a Chebyshev Type I filter, a Chebyshev Type II filter, and an Elliptic Filter. 

Finally the effects of this filter in action was shown using matlabs figure plotting functionality
Who's results can be seen in the included photos
